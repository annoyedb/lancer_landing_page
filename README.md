# lancer_landing_page
A simple single page mission site for GMs to use for introductions/campaign tracking. Uses tailwind CSS and vanilla JS. Images provided were generated from an AI LLM. Some knowledge of HTML,CSS and JS will be needed to make edits/customizations

This has limited responsiveness and probably won't look super awesome on small devices. I don't know if I am going to go down improvement on that front, but I may if I end up heavily revising this.

The comms log at the bottom of the page is somewhat complex. Dig into that at your own risk. Had Gemini help me through the tougher parts of that, so its probably not optimized, but I wanted something immersive quick. I'll expand dialog tree options further down the road and probably make it a bit more performant. 

All of the animations are CSS and vanilla JS. 

A version 2 of this is planned with some improvements to the data structure for pilots to centralize all of the stuff between the two squads.

Probably also improve the redacted sections and make them fancier style tooltips.

Here are some preview images
